## About Me
Assalam u Alaikum, I'm  Muhammad Abu Bakar. I graduated from Nixor College, completing and appearing for my GCE A Level Exam in 2024. Likewise, I did my GCE O Levels from Bahria College Karachi NORE-1 in 2022. I'm currently looking towards pursuing Computer Science as my major, and for my masters the specific field that I, as of now, desire to specialize in is CyberSecurity. I'm passionate about making a difference in the society, and contributing towards the growth of my country. Primarily, on an individual basis by stirving to be an examplry citizen, if not an examplry citizen then atleast a citizen who has never wronged anyone in the society.
